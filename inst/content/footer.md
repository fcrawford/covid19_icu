This app implements a model for utilization of ICU beds, floor beds, and patient deaths due to COVID-19.  The model was developed by the COVID-19 Statistics,
Policy modeling and Epidemiology Collective (C-SPEC).  The app was written by [Soheil Eshghi](http://www.soheileshghi.com/), [Margret Erlendsdottir] (https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/margret_erlendsdottir/), 
[Maile Thayer Phillips](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/maile_phillips/), [Suzan Iloglu](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/suzan_iloglu/), [Christian Testa](https://ctesta.com) 
and [Forrest W. Crawford](http://www.crawfordlab.io) using the [R](http://www.r-project.org) [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) framework.
